# React Todo List Application
This project is a simple yet intuitive Todo List application built using React.js. It communicates with a backend API to fetch, add, and delete todo items.

# Features:
  * View Todos: Lists all todos in their respective categories: "Open" and "Closed".
  * Add Todos: User can add new todo items using the input field provided.
  * Delete Todos: User can delete existing todos with a single click.
  * Update Todos: Todos can be moved between "Open" and "Closed" categories, effectively marking them as complete or incomplete.
 
# Technical Features:
  * React Hooks: The application utilizes useState and useEffect hooks for state management and side effects respectively.
  * Reusable Components: The codebase is divided into reusable components to provide modularity and clarity.
  * Custom HTTP Helper: The application includes a custom-built HTTP helper function that simplifies API calls and keeps the codebase clean.
  * PropTypes Checking: The application uses PropTypes for checking the props passed to components, which improves the reliability and           robustness of the codebase.

This project serves as a practical showcase of React.js skills, focusing on the use of hooks, reusable components, and interaction with an API. It is perfect for beginners looking for an example of a React.js project or for developers looking for a basic template for a Todo List application.
